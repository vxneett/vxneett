        <h1>I'm Sorry</h1>
        <p>Dear SHIVANGI❤️,</p>
        <p>
            I am truly sorry for my actions and the hurt they may have caused you. It pains me to think about how I let you down and affected the trust and happiness we share. 
            I deeply regret what I did, and there isn’t a moment that passes without wishing I could undo it. You mean so much to me, and the thought of losing our beautiful bond because of my mistakes is unbearable. 
            Please know that my intentions were never to hurt you, and I am committed to making things right. You are not just my best friend—you are someone who brings so much joy, comfort, and meaning to my life. 
            I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me and give me a chance to prove how much you and our friendship mean to me.
        </p>
